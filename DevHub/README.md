# 💻 DevHub - The Ultimate Developer OS & Dashboard

**DevHub** is a premium, high-performance dashboard template designed specifically for developers, engineering managers, and tech startups. It acts as a "Developer OS" to manage repositories, tasks, documentation, and team collaboration in one sleek interface.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Repo Management:** Visualize your GitHub/GitLab repositories and activities.
- **Task OS:** Integrated kanban or task list system for engineering sprints.
- **Documentation Hub:** A dedicated space for technical docs and internal wikis.
- **Developer Metrics:** Track coding heatmaps, commit frequency, and system health.
- **Community & Social:** Built-in community feed to stay connected with your team.
- **Workspace Switching:** Seamlessly toggle between different projects or teams.

## 🚀 Quick Start
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🛠 Customization
DevHub is highly modular. All core data is centralized in `src/data/`. You can update your repos, tasks, and documentation without touching the UI components. See `PREMIUM_GUIDE.md` for the full roadmap.
