# 📔 BrewAndCo - Premium Customization Guide

Welcome to the **BrewAndCo** family. Use this guide to customize your high-end roastery website.

## 1. Global Configuration
Open `constants.ts`. This file contains the "brain" of the website.
- Update your **Shop Name**, **Social Handles**, and **Contact Details**.
- Modify the **Tagline** and **Hero Text** to fit your brand's voice.

## 2. Managing the Experience
- **AIAssistant:** You can integrate your own AI chat logic in `src/components/AIAssistant.tsx`.
- **TracingPath:** Customize the brand journey in the `TracingPath` component to show your unique coffee sourcing process.

## 3. Styling with Tailwind
BrewAndCo uses a sophisticated color palette.
To adjust the primary colors or typography, modify `tailwind.config.js`. We recommend keeping the high-contrast "Dark Roast" look for a premium feel.

## 4. Deployment
- **Platform:** Vercel (Recommended), Netlify, or Github Pages.
- **Build Command:** `npm run build`
- **Output:** `dist` folder.
